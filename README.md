## What is this?

OW Escape Bind is a really simple program that listens for a specified key event and will bind it to your escape. It will only fire to the Overwatch window.
I mean, that's all it does really.

## Who is this for?

Anyone without an escape key for some reason.

## Compiling

Being very basic all you should really need is mingw. Compiling is as simple as 

```
gcc -o bind escbind.c
```
